<p>I was born in Plattsburgh, New York on May 28th, 1990. As a kid, I was a big-time nerd who loved art and music- two passions that never left! After high school, I studied math and French at SUNY Plattsburgh and graduated with my degree in 2010. Since then, I've taught ESL in France, served in Maine through AmeriCorps, earned a second degree in Gender & Women's Studies, and moved to Asheville, NC, to learn how to build websites at Tech Talent South.</p>
